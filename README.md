# knights-travails
## Assignment
The task is to build a function knight_moves that shows the shortest possible way to get from one square to another by outputting all squares the knight will stop on along the way.

One can think of the board as having 2-dimensional coordinates. The function would therefore look like:

knight_moves([0,0],[1,2]) == [[0,0],[1,2]]
